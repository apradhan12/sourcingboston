## Sourcing Boston: A Food Security and Resilience Hackathon
##### Visualizing the impact of climate change and other shocks to Boston's food system

## overview

How stable and just is Boston's food system? What does it look like, in size and complexity? 

On the weekend of November 10th and 11th, Northeastern University’s College of Arts, Media and Design and the Global Resilience Institute will host “Resilience Storytelling,” a hackathon where participants will explore data – from economic to environmental science to urban planning – to tell compelling stories and draw insights about food insecurity, economic disruption and resilience.

This event, in partnership with [Thomson Reuters Labs](https://innovation.thomsonreuters.com/en/labs.html) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), will challenge participants to leverage data, analytics and visualization to find new ways of telling stories and deriving insights about how climate change and other shocks can disrupt food systems, supply chains and basic infrastructure in Boston.

* *Interesting Research Question and Analytic Value*: Can you provide data-driven answers which are hard to get elsewhere?
* *Aesthetics*: Is it beautiful and a joy to use?
Extensibility: Could this be extended and/or incorporated into a larger system?
